# Face-Recognition-System
My Final Year College Project based on Machine Learning.
This project showcases an innovative attendance system that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately detect and recognize individuals. 
The system utilizes computer vision and machine learning algorithms to capture and process images, ensuring efficient and reliable attendance tracking.
